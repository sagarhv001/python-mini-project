## Hospital Patient Tracking System
This repository provides a simple, object-oriented patient tracking and management system for hospitals, along with a comprehensive test suite that logs all unit test activities to both the console and a log file.

## Files
### patient.py
Implements the Patient class for patient records, JSON serialization/deserialization utilities, and functions for registering and managing patients.

### test_patient.py
Contains unit tests for the Patient class and JSON utilities, using Python’s unittest framework.
This script logs the start/end of each test module, test case names, and test results (PASS/FAIL/ERROR) to both the console and a file named test_log.txt.

## Features
Patient Management using OOP (Patient class)
Serialization & deserialization to patients.json

## Unit tests for:
Patient creation and attributes
History (notes) management
Admission and discharge flow
Outpatient vs. inpatient logic
JSON file save/load operations

## Logging
Every test case logs start, end, and status to both the console and test_log.txt

## Usage
1. Main Patient Management Module
bash$ python patient.py
#### Register a patient (uncomment the last line in patient.py, or call the function in your own script)

3. Run Tests
bash$ python unit_test.py
After running the tests:

Review real-time logs in your terminal/console.

See the entire test execution log in test_log.txt.

Prerequisites
Python 3.10.+

No external packages required; all code uses Python’s standard library only.

You can extend this project by adding similar OOP and serialization for doctors, appointments, and more.

This is a basic demonstration. For production, consider adding user authentication, more granular data validation, and web or GUI frontends.
